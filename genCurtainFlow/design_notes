FRESHNESS param

controls the rate at which stripe models are replavced with new stripe models.

we'll have 4 or 5 stripe types and 2 or 3 subtypes within each type

we will repeat stripe type/subtypes to save resources.

greater freshness means greater frequency of new stripe/subtype creation.

less freshness means more repeats.
